    "[1] K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm is a type of Supervised Machine learning algorithms. This algorithm uses data for training while classifying a new data point or instance and it doesn't assume anything about the underlying data. It calculates the distance of a new data point to all other training data points and selects the K-nearest data points(K-any integer values). Finally it assigns the data point to the class to which the majority of the K data points belong.\n",

    "[1] Suppose a dataset with two variables generates the above plot. classify a new data point with 'X' into \"Blue\" class or \"Red\" class. The coordinate values of the data point are x=45 and y=50. Suppose the value of K is 3. The KNN algorithm starts by calculating the distance of point X from all the points. It then finds the 3 nearest points with least distance to point X. This is shown in the figure below. The three nearest points have been encircled. The final step of the KNN algorithm is to assign new point to the class to which majority of the three nearest points belong. From the figure above we can see that the two of the three nearest points belong to the class \"Red\" while one belongs to the class \"Blue\". Therefore the new data point will be classified as \"Red\"."

The job of the p-value is to decide whether we should accept our Null Hypothesis or reject it. The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference. p-values are often reported whenever you perform a statistical significance test (like t-test, chi-square test etc). These tests typically return a computed test statistic and the associated p-value. This reported value is used to establish the statistical significance of the relationships being tested.\n",

    "The t- statistic was introduced in 1908 by William Sealy Gosset, a chemist working for the Guinness brewery in Dublin, Ireland. The t-distribution was first derived as a posterior distribution in 1876 by Helmert and Lüroth. In the English-language literature it takes its name from William Sealy Gosset’s 1908 paper in Biometrika under the pseudonym “Student.” Gosset worked at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, Ireland, and was interested in the problems of small samples, for example of the chemical properties of barley where sample sizes might be as small as three participants. Gosset’s paper refers to the distribution as the “frequency distribution of standard deviations of samples drawn from a normal population.” It became well known through the work of Ronald A. Fisher, who called the distribution “Student’s distribution” and referred to the value as t."

    "Different types of t-test:\n",

    " 2. Two-sample t-test: If the groups come from two different populations (e.g. two different species), then perform a two-sample t-test. This test is also known as independent t-test.

    "Degrees of freedom are the number of ways the mean could vary. In this case, the degrees of freedom are the number of NPS ratings that you could have in a given group of respondents.
